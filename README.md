# Customer classification on Bertelsmann/Arvato datasets
## Introduction
This project is part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

## Goals
In this project i used unsupervised and supervised learning methods on datasets of a mail-order company for organic food. There were two main goals: 1. Meaningfull Data Analysis on what differences are there between customers of the company and the general population. 2. Build a model to predict potential costumers on unseen data via a training dataset.
